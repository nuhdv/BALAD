# BALAD
## Usage
1. run main.py for sample usage.
2. Data set: You may want to find the sample input data set in the "datasets" folder.
2. Pre-trained models: You may want to utilize the pre-trained models in the "pretrain_models" folder.
3. The input path can be an individual data set or just a folder. 
4. The performance might have slight differences between two independent runs. In our paper, we report the average AUC-ROC, AUC-PR with std over 5 runs. 
5. sDSADS, sPSM and sSWaT are too large, and the download link will be available soon.
